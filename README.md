This post was inspired by a comment to my [previous graph on vitamin C](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8fyu1i/vitamin_c_in_some_common_foods_oc/), where someone said that if you have to think about 1 vitamin so much then we are doomed. The truth is that staple foods cover almost everything and there are only few vitamins left to think about, but some staple foods cover our needs better than others and I didn't know which ones are the best, so here it is. 

Those few remaining vitamins are (with best popular sources):

- vitamin A - carrots, sweet potatoes
- vitamin C - red/yellow bell peppers, oranges, broccoli, strawberries
- vitamin E - sunflower seeds, almonds (and this is not even that important - ["Frank vitamin E deficiency is rare and overt deficiency symptoms have not been found in healthy people who obtain little vitamin E from their diets."](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-HealthProfessional/#h5))
- vitamin K - spinach, kale, arugula, broccoli (if it's a green plant food it probably has some)

(vitamin B12 should be supplemented, so it's also excluded for better data)

"Is soy even acceptable to have in the diet?"
Here is a [recent review from Examine.com](https://examine.com/nutrition/is-soy-good-or-bad/?utm_campaign=is-soy-good-or-bad-for-you&utm_medium=social_link&utm_source=missinglettr).

TLDR: "Moderate consumption of soy foods is unlikely to have adverse effects in adults; it may even benefit cardiovascular health and reduce cancer risk. Eating large amounts of soy foods for 6 months or more, however, may cause problems. Also, the use of soy infant formulas should probably be minimized."

Large amounts of soy start at (per day):

- 350 g of boiled soy beans
- 2 liters of soy milk
- 800 g of tofu
- 400 g of tempeh
- 260 g of soy protein isolate

Those values are based on average isoflavone content (we didn't see any negative effects in doses up to 240 mg/day) and there are only two case reports of negative effects at higher doses (~360 mg/day for 6-12 months).

-------------------------------

Worth mentioning:

- sweet potatoes have 458% vit A !
- salmon has 73% vit E
- potatoes 48% vit C 
- corn 44% vit C 
- shrimp has 42% vit A and 62% vit E
- eggs have 54% vit A
- swiss cheese 41% vit A
- cheddar cheese 46% vit A

Good luck & have fun :)
